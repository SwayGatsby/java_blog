# Java Web App - Blog

## Summary

A java project created over 5 days as part of CodeClan's 16 week development course. The point of the project was to embed and build on Java learning done as part of the course. The options given were to create core Java logic for various scenarios or to create a food tracker or to-do list Android app. As we had already created a web app using Ruby, I wanted to do something similar with Java and therefore created my own project outline and learning objectives.

This involved considerable additional learning including the Spark web framework, Handlebars templating language, IntelliJ, Maven, and using PostgreSQL with Java.

## Requirements

A blog must be able to: 

* allow user to add posts
* persist the posts in a database.
* retrieve and display the posts.


## Built With

* [Spark](http://sparkjava.com/documentation) - web framework
